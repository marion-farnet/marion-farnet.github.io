     <div class="about_jpii"> <br> “None can sense more deeply than you artists, 
        ingenious creators of beauty that you are, something of the pathos with which God at the dawn of creation
         looked upon the work of his hands. A glimmer of that feeling has shone so often in your eyes when—like the artists of every age—captivated 
         by the hidden power of sounds and words, colours and shapes, you have admired the work of your inspiration, sensing in it some echo of the 
         mystery of creation with which God, the sole creator of all things, has wished in some way to associate you.
     <br> <br> 
        Not all are called to be artists in the specific sense of the term. Yet, as Genesis has it, 
        all men and women are entrusted with the task of crafting their own life: in a certain sense, they are to 
         make of it a work of art, a masterpiece.” 
    <br><br>
